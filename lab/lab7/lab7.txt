STEP1:
Q1) no we cannot because it takes in 2 arguments which would mean that it is global 
		instead of taking in the object that calls it.
Q2) The 2 functions woud have to be a friend of Shape which allows them to access
		private variables even if they are not part of the class.

STEP2:
Which function are you going to make polymorphic?	area and display
• How will you make it polymorphic? 	by having virtual functions, dynamic linkage 
														or late binding
• Can it be a pure virtual function?	no, because if it is then you wont be able to define it
• Which class have you made an abstract base class? Shape
