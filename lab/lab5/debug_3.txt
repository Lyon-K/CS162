firstly, compile with -g tag and run gdb with argument of data.tsv as requested, then by runing, an error will occur specifically stating:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
__exchange_and_add_dispatch (__val=-1, __mem=0x29)
    at /usr/src/debug/gcc-4.8.5-20150702/obj-x86_64-redhat-linux/x86_64-redhat-linux/libstdc++-v3/include/ext/atomicity.h:84
84            return __exchange_and_add_single(__mem, __val);
we then start again and next until the segfault which is at line 109, by starting again and stepping into it we will arrive at a do while loop that gets last name, first name, and id of a person and set it into people. after i = 8, we attempt to go and set the new_person at index 8 which arrives at a seg fault as people is defined with an array of 8 which has a maximum index of 7. this can be fixed by increasing the size of people.

the do while loop should also stop when i < n

in steinbeck's id ther is a letter which caused the buffer to read in ints to crash and stop reading ints so we have to take away the "A" and the same goes for Elizebeth

average should be calculated by adding all age then only dividing it by n

maximum should be updated if it is less than what is being checked instead of more than
